    The electric current flowing through coils in a fusion device. Coil current represents the magnitude of charge flow per unit time through a conductor that forms part of a magnetic field-generating electromagnetic coil system.

    Coil current is defined as the rate of flow of electric charge through the coil:

    $$I = \frac{dQ}{dt}$$

    where:
    - $I$ is the coil current in amperes (A)
    - $Q$ is the electric charge in coulombs (C)
    - $t$ is time in seconds (s)

    The conventional direction of current flow is from positive to negative potential, corresponding to the direction opposite to electron flow.

    Coil current in fusion devices is used to generate magnetic fields for plasma confinement, shaping, and position control. Different coil systems serve specific functions:

    - Toroidal field coils generate the main toroidal magnetic field
    - Poloidal field coils control plasma shape and position
    - Central solenoid coils induce plasma current through transformer action
    - Correction coils adjust field errors and provide additional control
     
    In stellarators, complex 3D coil geometries produce the confining magnetic field directly without requiring a large plasma current.

    The sign convention for coil currents defines positive current as that which generates magnetic field in the clockwise direction when viewed along the direction of the current.
