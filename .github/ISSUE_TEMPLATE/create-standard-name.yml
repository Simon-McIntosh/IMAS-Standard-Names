        Standard names consist of lower case letters, digits and underscores, begin with a letter, and must not contain whitespace. Guidelines for the construction of IMAS Standard Names can be found [here](https://github.com/iterorganization/IMAS-Standard-Names/blob/main/docs/guidelines.md).

        Use SI units unless an alternative is widely adopted by the community. 
        Enter dimensionless if the physical quantity is dimensionless 
        and none if Standard Name is unitless.

          <summary>Review Process</summary>
          <br>
          1. Standard Name proposals are automaticaly validated, checking for guideline compliance and name uniqueness (unless the overwrite option is selected).
          <br>
          2. The submitter should check the accuracy of the proposal by consulting the on-line documentation provided.
          <br>
          3. The submitter assigns at least one reviewer to the issue.
          <br>
          4. Review concludes when a reviewer with appropriate permissions adds the approve label.
          <br>
          5. Approved standard names are automatically committed to the submit branch and incorporated into a pull request to develop.
          <br>
          6. Standard names are periodically promoted from develop to main as tagged releases.
