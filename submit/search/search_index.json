Coil current represents the magnitude of charge flow per unit time through a conductor that forms part of a magnetic field-generating electromagnetic coil system.</p> <p>Coil current is defined as the rate of flow of electric charge through the coil:</p> \\[I = \\frac{dQ}{dt}\\] <p>where: - \\(I\\) is the coil current in amperes (A) - \\(Q\\) is the electric charge in coulombs (C) - \\(t\\) is time in seconds (s)</p> <p>The conventional direction of current flow is from positive to negative potential, corresponding to the direction opposite to electron flow.</p> <p>Coil current in fusion devices is used to generate magnetic fields for plasma confinement, shaping, and position control. Different coil systems serve specific functions:</p> <ul> <li>Toroidal field coils generate the main toroidal magnetic field</li> <li>Poloidal field coils control plasma shape and position</li> <li>Central solenoid coils induce plasma current through transformer action</li> <li>Correction coils adjust field errors and provide additional control</li> </ul> <p>In stellarators, complex 3D coil geometries produce the confining magnetic field directly without requiring a large plasma current.</p> <p>The sign convention for coil currents defines positive current as that which generates magnetic field in the clockwise direction when viewed along the direction of the current.</p>"}]}
