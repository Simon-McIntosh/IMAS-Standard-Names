description: Plasma current density vector.
documentation: |-
  Current density vector $\mathbf{J}$ in the plasma, representing the spatial distribution of electric current. Related to [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) via Ampère's law and determines the self-generated poloidal magnetic field essential for plasma equilibrium and MHD stability. The total current includes contributions from ohmic current, bootstrap current, and externally driven current.

  $$\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}$$

  where $\mathbf{B}$ is magnetic field in T, $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}$ H/m is the vacuum permeability, and $\mathbf{J}$ is in A/m$^2$.

  Physical significance:

  The current density profile determines the self-generated [poloidal_magnetic_field](#poloidal_magnetic_field), which is essential for plasma equilibrium and MHD stability. Current density affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) profiles and determines [plasma_current](#plasma_current) distribution. Bootstrap current (self-generated by pressure gradients) and external current drive modify the profile. See [current_density](#current_density) for magnitude relationships and [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) for field structure.

  Measurement methods:

  Plasma current density is determined from equilibrium reconstruction using external [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) measurements. [Flux_loop_voltage](#flux_loop_voltage) integration provides poloidal field information for current calculation. MSE (motional Stark effect) diagnostics provide direct current density measurements in some devices. Polarimetry measures current density from Faraday rotation effects. Current profile analysis requires [magnetic_axis](#magnetic_axis) location and [plasma_boundary](#plasma_boundary) geometry.

  Typical values:

  Peak values in plasma core typically range from $10^5$ to $10^6$ A/m$^2$ depending on [plasma_current](#plasma_current) and current profile shape. Current density profiles typically peak on-axis and decrease toward the edge.

  Sign convention: Positive current density follows the right-hand rule for toroidal current direction, consistent with [plasma_current](#plasma_current) measurements and tokamak operation conventions.
