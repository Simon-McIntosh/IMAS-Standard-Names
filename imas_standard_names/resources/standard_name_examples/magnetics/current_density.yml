name: current_density
description: Electric current density magnitude.
documentation: |-
  Electric current density magnitude $|\mathbf{j}|$ representing the spatial distribution of current flow. For the full vector field, see [plasma_current_density](#plasma_current_density).

  $$|\mathbf{j}| = \sqrt{j_R^2 + j_{\phi}^2 + j_Z^2}$$

  where components are in cylindrical coordinates (R, $\phi$, Z).

  Physical significance:

  Current density profile shape affects MHD stability and confinement. Peaked profiles with high on-axis current reduce [safety_factor](#safety_factor) and can trigger instabilities. Bootstrap current and external current drive modify the profile. The current density relates to [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) via Ampère's law and determines [poloidal_magnetic_field](#poloidal_magnetic_field) strength.

  Relation to plasma current:

  Integrating toroidal component over plasma cross-section gives total [plasma_current](#plasma_current):

  $$I_p = \int j_{\phi} \, dA$$

  where $j_{\phi}$ is toroidal [plasma_current_density](#plasma_current_density) in A/m$^2$ and $dA$ is differential area element in m$^2$.

  Measurement methods:

  Magnetic diagnostics measure current density through [flux_loop_voltage](#flux_loop_voltage) integration and external magnetic field measurements. Equilibrium reconstruction codes invert magnetic measurements to determine current profiles. Polarimetry measures current density from Faraday rotation effects.

  Typical values:

  Peak values in plasma core: $10^5$-$10^6$ A/m$^2$ depending on [plasma_current](#plasma_current) and profile shape. Edge values typically 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than core values.
