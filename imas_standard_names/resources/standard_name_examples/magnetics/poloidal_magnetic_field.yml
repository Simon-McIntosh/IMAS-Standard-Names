description: Poloidal magnetic field vector.
documentation: |-
  Poloidal magnetic field vector $\mathbf{B}_p$ lying in the poloidal plane (R-Z plane), comprising radial and vertical components. The poloidal field is generated by toroidal [plasma_current](#plasma_current) and external poloidal field coils, providing the rotational transform necessary for tokamak confinement.

  $$\mathbf{B}_p = B_R \hat{e}_R + B_Z \hat{e}_Z$$

  where $B_R$ is [radial_component_of_magnetic_field](#radial_component_of_magnetic_field), $B_Z$ is [vertical_component_of_magnetic_field](#vertical_component_of_magnetic_field), both in T.

  Physical significance:

  The poloidal field is generated by toroidal [plasma_current](#plasma_current) and external poloidal field coils. It provides the rotational transform of field lines necessary for tokamak confinement and determines plasma shape through equilibrium force balance. Poloidal field strength affects [safety_factor](#safety_factor) profiles and MHD stability limits. See [poloidal_component_of_magnetic_field](#poloidal_component_of_magnetic_field) for magnitude relationships and [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) for total field structure.

  Relation to plasma current:

  The poloidal field relates to [plasma_current_density](#plasma_current_density) via Ampère's law:

  $$\nabla \times \mathbf{B}_p = \mu_0 j_{\phi} \hat{e}_{\phi}$$

  where $j_{\phi}$ is toroidal current density in A/m$^2$ and $\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}$ H/m.

  Measurement methods:

  Poloidal magnetic field is measured using magnetic probes and flux loops positioned around the plasma. [Flux_loop_voltage](#flux_loop_voltage) integration provides field change information. Equilibrium reconstruction codes invert external magnetic measurements to determine internal field structure. MSE diagnostics provide direct poloidal field measurements in some devices. Vector field analysis requires multiple measurement locations.

  Typical values:

  Poloidal field strength typically ranges from 0.1-1 T, much smaller than toroidal field but essential for confinement. Field strength varies with radius and [plasma_current](#plasma_current).

  Sign convention: Positive poloidal field follows the right-hand rule for toroidal current direction, consistent with [plasma_current](#plasma_current) measurements and standard tokamak conventions.
