description: Poloidal component of magnetic field.
documentation: |-
  Magnitude of the poloidal component of the [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) vector $B_p$ in the poloidal plane. The poloidal field component is generated by [plasma_current](#plasma_current) and external poloidal field coils, determining [safety_factor](#safety_factor) and MHD stability limits.

  $$B_p = \sqrt{B_R^2 + B_Z^2}$$

  where $B_R$ is [radial_component_of_magnetic_field](#radial_component_of_magnetic_field) and $B_Z$ is [vertical_component_of_magnetic_field](#vertical_component_of_magnetic_field), both in T.

  Physical significance:

  The poloidal field component is generated by [plasma_current](#plasma_current) and external poloidal field coils. The ratio of toroidal to poloidal field determines the [safety_factor](#safety_factor): $q \propto B_{\phi} / B_p$, a key parameter for MHD stability. Poloidal field strength affects plasma shaping and equilibrium control. See [poloidal_magnetic_field](#poloidal_magnetic_field) for vector relationships and [toroidal_component_of_magnetic_field](#toroidal_component_of_magnetic_field) for field comparison.

  Measurement methods:

  Poloidal magnetic field is measured using magnetic probes and flux loops positioned around the plasma. [Flux_loop_voltage](#flux_loop_voltage) integration provides poloidal field information. Equilibrium reconstruction codes invert external magnetic measurements to determine internal field structure. MSE (motional Stark effect) diagnostics provide direct poloidal field measurements. Poloidal field analysis requires [magnetic_axis](#magnetic_axis) location and [plasma_boundary](#plasma_boundary) geometry.

  Typical values:

  0.1-1 T, depending on [plasma_current](#plasma_current) and radial position. Much smaller than [toroidal_component_of_magnetic_field](#toroidal_component_of_magnetic_field) but essential for plasma confinement and stability.

  Sign convention: Positive poloidal field follows the right-hand rule for current direction, consistent with [plasma_current](#plasma_current) measurements and tokamak operation conventions.
