name: electron_temperature
description: Electron kinetic temperature.
documentation: |-
  Electron kinetic temperature $T_e$ representing the mean thermal energy per electron. In fusion plasmas, electron temperature typically ranges from tens of eV in the edge region to several keV in the plasma core.

  Thermodynamic relation:

  Electron temperature relates to [electron_pressure](#electron_pressure) via the ideal gas law:

  $$p_e = n_e k_B T_e$$

  where $n_e$ is [electron_density](#electron_density) in m$^{-3}$, $k_B = 1.381 \times 10^{-23}$ J/K is Boltzmann's constant, $T_e$ is in K, giving $p_e$ in Pa. When using $T_e$ in eV, apply conversion: $p_e = n_e T_e \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ Pa.

  Physical significance:

  Temperature determines [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) and fusion reactivity. Higher electron temperatures improve confinement quality and increase fusion reaction rates. The temperature gradient drives [electron_heat_flux](#electron_heat_flux) and affects [plasma_resistivity](#plasma_resistivity). See also [ion_temperature](#ion_temperature) and [electron_temperature_at_magnetic_axis](#electron_temperature_at_magnetic_axis).

  Measurement methods:

  Thomson scattering provides local [electron_density](#electron_density) and temperature measurements. Electron cyclotron emission measures temperature from radiation spectrum. X-ray spectroscopy determines temperature from continuum and line emissions. Interferometry provides line-integrated density for pressure calculations.

  Typical values:

  Edge region: 10-200 eV, core region: 1-20 keV in high-performance tokamak plasmas. On-axis values in [electron_temperature_at_magnetic_axis](#electron_temperature_at_magnetic_axis) typically reach 5-15 keV during auxiliary heating.
