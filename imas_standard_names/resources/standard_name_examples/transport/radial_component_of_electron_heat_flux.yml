description: Radial component of electron heat flux vector.
documentation: |-
  Radial component of the electron heat flux vector $q_{e,R}$ in cylindrical coordinates, representing thermal energy transport by electrons in the major radius direction. This component determines radial energy transport and affects [energy_confinement_time](#energy_confinement_time) through outward heat loss from the plasma core.

  $$q_{e,R} = -n_e \chi_e \frac{\partial T_e}{\partial R}$$

  where $n_e$ is electron density in m$^{-3}$, $\chi_e$ is [electron_thermal_diffusivity](#electron_thermal_diffusivity) in m$^2$/s, $\partial T_e / \partial R$ is the radial temperature gradient in eV/m, giving $q_{e,R}$ in W/m$^2$.

  Physical significance:

  Electron heat flux is driven by temperature gradients and turbulent transport. Analysis of radial heat flux profiles is essential for validating transport models and understanding energy confinement. Radial heat flux determines the energy loss rate from the core and affects [plasma_current](#plasma_current) requirements. See [electron_heat_flux](#electron_heat_flux) for vector relationships and [electron_thermal_diffusivity](#electron_thermal_diffusivity) for transport coefficients.

  Measurement methods:

  Radial electron heat flux is inferred from [electron_temperature](#electron_temperature) profile measurements using transport analysis. Thomson scattering provides local temperature measurements for gradient calculations. Electron cyclotron emission measures temperature profiles. Heat flux analysis requires equilibrium reconstruction using [magnetic_field](#magnetic_field) measurements and power balance calculations. Radial profiles require multiple measurement locations.

  Typical values:

  Core region: $10^4$-$10^6$ W/m$^2$, edge region: $10^6$-$10^8$ W/m$^2$ near the pedestal. Radial heat flux typically increases toward the edge due to steeper temperature gradients and reduced confinement.

  Sign convention: Positive indicates outward (increasing R direction) heat flow from plasma core to edge, following standard cylindrical coordinate conventions.
