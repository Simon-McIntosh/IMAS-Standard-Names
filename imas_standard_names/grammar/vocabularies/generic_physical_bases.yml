# Generic physical bases that require qualification
#
# These physical quantities are too generic to stand alone as physical_base
# and MUST be qualified with subject, device, object, or positional context.
#
# Rationale:
# - Generic terms like "current" or "temperature" are ambiguous without context
# - Following CF metadata conventions: physical quantities need sufficient specificity
# - Device/object context distinguishes measurement source from physical quantity
#
# Validation rules:
# - If physical_base matches a token in this list AND
# - No qualifying segment is present (subject, device, object, position, geometry)
# - Then the name is invalid (too generic)
#
# Examples of INVALID names:
#   - current                    (too generic - current of/through what?)
#   - power                      (too generic - power from/to what?)
#   - temperature                (too generic - temperature of what species?)
#   - voltage                    (too generic - voltage from/across what?)
#
# Examples of VALID names:
#   - plasma_current                                    (generic "current" + implicit plasma object)
#   - poloidal_field_coil_current                       (generic "current" + device qualifier)
#   - electron_temperature                              (generic "temperature" + subject qualifier)
#   - ion_cyclotron_heating_antenna_forward_power       (generic "power" + device qualifier)
#   - poloidal_magnetic_field_probe_voltage             (generic "voltage" + device qualifier)
#   - area_of_flux_loop                                 (generic "area" + object qualifier)
#   - volume_enclosed_by_flux_surface                   (generic "volume" + geometry qualifier)
#   - pressure_at_magnetic_axis                         (generic "pressure" + position qualifier)
#
# Contrast with specific physical bases (NOT in this list):
#   - magnetic_field             (specific physical quantity, can stand alone)
#   - poloidal_magnetic_flux     (specific quantity with coordinate qualifier)
#   - safety_factor              (specific dimensionless parameter)
#   - diamagnetic_flux           (specific type of flux, not generic "flux")
