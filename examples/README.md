## Guidelines

- Examples live outside the package namespace to avoid adding non-library code to the installed wheel.
- Keep dependencies limited to the main package and standard library.
- Mirror any significant example in the documentation (e.g. Quick Start appendix).

Kind Particularities:

- scalar: minimal; ensure canonical unit format and description (see rollback pattern in `scalar_basic.py`).
- scalar with provenance: add provenance with `mode: operator` or `reduction`; name pattern enforced (e.g. `time_derivative_of_<base>`).
- vector: all component scalars must be present (staged before vector insert); component names `<axis>_component_of_<vector>`.
- vector with provenance: same as vector, plus provenance block; component scalars must exist before vector.

Contributions: add a short docstring explaining steps, prefer explicit prints over implicit state. Provide rollback examples where mutation safety is relevant.
