It is defined as the integral of the poloidal magnetic field component over this surface. The poloidal flux is an important quantity because magnetic field lines lie on surfaces of constant poloidal flux in axisymmetric equilibria.</p> <p>The normalization provides several advantages:</p> <ul> <li>It creates a dimensionless coordinate that ranges from 0 to 1, making it easy to compare different plasma configurations</li> <li>It accounts for differences in absolute flux values across different devices or operating conditions</li> <li>It provides a natural coordinate system for plasma transport and stability analyses</li> </ul> <p>The sign convention for normalized poloidal flux is such that it increases monotonically from the magnetic axis outward to the plasma boundary. This definition applies to both tokamaks and stellarators, although in stellarators the lack of axisymmetry can introduce complications in the precise definition of flux surfaces.</p>"}]}
