It represents the integrated toroidal current density over the plasma cross-section and is a fundamental parameter in magnetic confinement fusion devices.</p> <p>The mathematical definition of plasma current is:</p> \\[I_p = \\iint j_\\phi \\, dA\\] <p>where \\(I_p\\) is the plasma current, \\(j_\\phi\\) is the toroidal component of the current density (A/m\u00b2), and the integration is performed over the entire poloidal cross-section of the plasma.</p> <p>In axisymmetric tokamaks, the plasma current flows primarily in the toroidal direction and creates a poloidal magnetic field component that is essential for plasma confinement. The sign convention for plasma current is that a positive value indicates current flowing in the counter-clockwise direction when viewed from above the torus.</p> <p>The plasma current serves several critical functions in fusion plasmas:</p> <ul> <li>It generates the poloidal component of the magnetic field necessary for plasma equilibrium</li> <li>It drives ohmic heating through resistive dissipation</li> <li>It affects plasma stability by modifying the safety factor profile</li> <li>It influences plasma confinement through its effect on the magnetic configuration</li> </ul> <p>In stellarators, which rely primarily on external coils for confinement, the plasma current is typically much smaller but still plays a role in the overall plasma behavior and equilibrium.</p> <p>The plasma current can be driven by several mechanisms:</p> <ul> <li>Inductive current drive (transformer action)</li> <li>Non-inductive current drive methods such as:</li> <li>Neutral beam injection (NBI)</li> <li>Radio-frequency waves</li> <li>Bootstrap current (self-generated by plasma pressure gradients)</li> </ul>"}]}
