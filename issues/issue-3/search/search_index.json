Coil current is a fundamental parameter that determines the magnetic field strength and configuration in fusion devices.</p> <p>Coil current is measured in amperes (A) and represents the rate of flow of electric charge through the coil conductor. In fusion devices, coil currents generate magnetic fields used for plasma confinement, shaping, stability control, and disruption mitigation.</p> <p>The sign convention for coil current follows the right-hand rule: when the fingers of the right hand curl in the direction of current flow, the thumb points in the direction of the generated magnetic field. For poloidal field coils, positive current typically flows counter-clockwise when seen from above the device. For toroidal field coils, positive current typically generates a magnetic field in the counter-clockwise direction when viewed from above.</p> <p>In stellarators, coil currents are often fixed during operation, while in tokamaks, some coil currents (particularly PF coils) may be actively controlled during plasma operation.</p> <p>Mathematical definition: I = dQ/dt</p> <p>Where: - I is the current in amperes (A) - dQ/dt is the rate of charge flow in coulombs per second (C/s)</p> <p>Usage examples: 1. Poloidal field coil currents for plasma shape control 2. Toroidal field coil currents for main confinement field 3. Error field correction coil currents 4. ELM control coil currents</p>"}]}
